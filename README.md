# CPU Scheduling Simulator

A CPU scheduling simulator implemented in Java. This project simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms and provides a hands-on way to understand how different scheduling methods affect performance metrics.

## Overview

CPU Scheduling Simulator is designed to help students and professionals learn about CPU scheduling by visualizing the behavior of common scheduling algorithms. The simulator demonstrates how algorithms such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF), Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin operate, and it calculates metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and response time to analyze performance.

## Features

- **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:** Supports common scheduling strategies including FCFS, SJF, Priority Scheduling, and Round Robin (extendable to others).
- **Interactive Simulation:** Allows users to input process parameters (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.) and observe the scheduling process.
- **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays essential metrics such as waiting time, turnaround time, and CPU utilization.
- **Extensible Design:** Easily add new algorithms or customize existing ones to suit educational or experimental needs.

## Requirements

- **Java JDK 8 or higher:** Ensure you have a compatible Java environment installed.
- **Development Environment:** While you can use any text editor, the project includes IntelliJ IDEA project files for a smoother setup experience.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KFMBB/CPU-Scheduling-Simulator.git
## Open the Project

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

## Build the Project

Use your IDEâ€™s build tools or command-line tools (if applicable) to compile the project.

## Usage

### Run the Simulator

Execute the main class (for example, `Main.java` or a similarly named file) to start the simulator.

### Follow On-screen Prompts

Input the number of processes and provide parameters such as arrival times, burst times, and priorities.

### View Results

The simulator will run the selected scheduling algorithm and display the process execution order, along with key performance metrics.
